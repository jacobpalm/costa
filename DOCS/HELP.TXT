 ** 1.1 - What is Costa? **

    Costa is a shell with a graphical user interface, which replaces the
   DOS-prompt with a mouse operated environment consisting of windows,
   buttons, textboxes and such. The low system requirements make Costa very
   useful for older machines, which are also the machines that typically run
   the MS-DOS operating system.

    When using Costa, you can use icons to launch programs instead of long
   and difficult commands. Launching a program is just a mouse click away,
   and Costa even comes with a collection of programs to replace the ones
   that came with MS-DOS. All of these programs act and look like Costa
   itself, which means better consistency between programs and an easier
   learning curve for users.

    Costa uses a desktop to show you the programs on your computer. Users
   who have tried Windows will be familiar with Costa's desktop, as the two
   are not unlike each other. The icons on Costa's desktop are fully
   customizable, and can be moved around freely. You can add more icons if
   you want to, or you can remove or modify the existing ones.


 ** 1.2 - System requirements **

    Unlike most of the modern interfaces, Costa doesn't require much to run.
   Below you'll find a list of Costa's requirements.

    - A 286-processor or better (386 recommended, tested down to 16 MHz)
    - At least 250 KB free conventional RAM is recommended. When running a
      program, the resident part of Costa will use only a few hundred bytes
      of RAM
    - 2 MB free hard drive space on the installation drive recommended
    - VGA capable monitor and graphics card (640x480 pixels, 16 colours)
    - DOS 3.1 or newer
    
     If your computer doesn't meet one or more of the above requirements,
    Costa might behave strangely or not work at all.

     Although a mouse is not required, it is recommended to improve the user 
    experience. Costa works with all Microsoft-compatible mice and includes
    a driver that will be loaded automatically if you haven't loaded one.

     For slow hard drives, disk caching software such as SmartDrive is
    recommended. Costa loads most data in to memory, but in order to conserve
    memory some resources are loaded on use. Icons are one example of data
    that is loaded on every use.

    
 ** 1.3 - News in the version **

    This version of Costa has many improvements over the last version, and
   introduces a few new features. Among them are improved speed, full support 
   for mouse-less scenarios and a whole new look and feel.
   
    For a complete listing of changes, see DOCS\CHANGES.TXT.


 ** 1.4 - About Costa **

    The Costa development started in February 2004 and I worked on it almost
   every day for a couple of years. Then, I felt the need to move on to other 
   projects. Costa was abandoned, and left untouched for a long, long time.
   Then, in 2008, I decided to finish what I started. I took the old source
   code to various versions of Costa, studied it and thought of what was
   good, and what was bad. I decided to do a complete rewrite, and quickly
   made a GUI toolkit to allow quick and fairly easy development of programs. 
   Soon after, the desktop was completed.

    Costa was made using Microsoft Visual Basic for MS-DOS. I didn't use the
   forms engine in Visual Basic for MS-DOS, I wrote everything from scratch.
   Although the code to load the fonts was written by me, the fonts were made
   by other people. The document README.TXT in the DATA\FONTS directory
   contains more information about this, and gives proper credit to the
   authors.

    Although I've made Costa myself, some people have helped me with some
   tips and tricks. I would like to thank Todd Suess for his tips on
   stability, and the rest of the QBasic community for answering my questions 
   at the various forums out there.

| 2.0 - Using Costa                                                          |
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ** 2.1 - Starting Costa **
    Starting Costa is very simple. Simply navigate to the directory in which
   you placed Costa's files, and type this DOS command:

     COSTA.BAT
    
    This will bring you to Costa's desktop. The first time you run Costa, you
   may be greeted by a message telling you to run SETUP.EXE in order to set
   up the path to Costas data. If so, simply launch the program as instructed
   and input the path to the directory in which you placed Costa.

    Tip: If you have moved Costa, or it doesn't launch properly when running
   COSTA.BAT, run SETUP.EXE again at any time to fix the issue.


 ** 2.2 - Exiting Costa **

    To exit Costa, close any program you have running to return to the
   desktop. Once you see the desktop, simply click the "Exit" button and
   then confirm that you want to exit. If you don't have a mouse, you can
   always activate any button by pressing the underlined letter on your
   keyboard - on the "Exit" button, "E" is underlined, so press the "E" key
   to exit.


 ** 2.3 - Managing desktop links **
    
    To open a desktop link using the mouse, double-click it.

    Managing desktop links is as easy as it gets. To customize an existing
   link or to open the file/program it points to, just right-click it using
   the mouse. You can also use the TAB key on your keyboard to cycle through
   the icons from left to right, and then press Enter when the desired icon
   is highlighted. Use Shift+TAB to cycle through links in reverse order.
   
    Once the icon has been right-clicked, you will get a menu with four
   choices: 
   
     -Open/run
      Run the program or open the target file specified for this desktop link

     -Customize..
      Opens a dialog where you can change the target filename, path, icon and
      more. If the "Pause after execution" checkbox is selected, Costa will
      wait for a key press before returning to the desktop once the program
      is ends. This is usefull if you need to see the output of a program
      before returning to the desktop.

     -Move
      Allows you to move the icon freely around the screen. Once the icon is
      where you want it to be, click any mouse button. If you don't have a
      mouse, use the arrow keys to move the icon and press Enter when done.

     -Remove
      Removes the desktop link permanently. Costa will ask you to confirm
      this action.

    To close the menu without choosing any options, click outside of the menu
   or press the Escape key.

    To add a new desktop link, click the "Add link" button in the top right
   corner of the desktop. The dialog mentioned earlier under "Customize"
   will appear to allow you to define the properties of your new link. If you
   click "Cancel" in this dialog, no new link will be added.


 ** 2.4 Running DOS commands **

    You can execute a DOS command directly from the desktop, without having
   to open a DOS prompt first. To do so, click the "Execute" button on the
   desktop. This will show a dialog where you can enter a DOS command, or
   open a file associated with a program.

    To run a command or open a program, simply type the command/filename in
   the input field and click "OK".

    Similarly, to open a file associated with a program, type its filename
   and click "OK".


 ** 2.5 Using without a mouse **

    Costa can be used entirely without a mouse. Even if you do have a mouse,
   it can be beneficial to know how to use Costa with the keyboard. Some
   actions can be performed faster with the keyboard than the mouse.

    All around in Costa, you will see underlined letters. For instance, all
   buttons have an underlined letter. Labels above input fields also have an
   underlined letter. To use a button, or to activate an inputfield, simply
   press the underlined letter on the keyboard (unlike some other GUIs, you
   don't need to hold down the ALT key at the same time).

    In some places, you will see buttons with an arrow on them. To use these
   buttons, simply press the corresponding arrow key on the keyboard.

    While you are using an input field, all pressed keys will be entered into
   the field. To finish editing, press the Enter key to save your input, or
   press the ESC key to revert the input field to the previous value and
   finish editing.

    The open file in textviewer can be scrolled up and down using the arrow
   up and arrow down keys - you can also use the Page Up and Page Down keys
   to scroll entire pages.

    In the icon editor, use the arror keys to select the pixel you want to
   paint, and then press the space or Enter key to paint it. If the indicator
   is hidden, pressing the space or Enter key will reveal it. Pressing again
   will paint the selected pixel.

    In Tic Tac Toe, you can use the numeric keypad to place an X or O on the
   game board.

    Lastly, the "Select object" dialog in the theme editor can be navigated
   using the arrow up and arrow down keys, with the Enter key being used to
   confirm the selection.

| 3.0 - Customizing Costa                                                    |
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ** 3.1 Profiles **

    Costa supports five different profiles. Each profile has it's one name
   and icon, and it's own settings.
   This feature can be used in several ways, depending on your needs. For
   instance:

    - If multiple users are using the same computer, each user can name a
      profile for themselves, and have their own settings, color theme and
      desktoop links.

    - If you use the computer for both work and playing games, you could have
      a profile with all your work links on the desktop, and another profile
      with all your game links on the desktop.

    - If you use Costa as a launcher for DOS games, you could make a profile
      for each genre of games. For instance, seperate profiles named "RPGs",
      "Platform", "Simulation and "Action".

    So, how you use this feature is really up to you. If you don't see any
   use in the feature, you can go to the Config dialog and set Costa to
   always launch directly into the last used profile, rather than showing the
   profile selection dialog at launch. See section 3.2 and 3.5 of this
   document for more information.


 ** 3.2 Launching the Configuration program **

    On the desktop you will find a built-in shortcut named "Configuration".
   This shortcut can be moved like any other shortcut, but cannot be removed
   or customized. Clicking it will open the Configuration program, which
   allows you to change the appearance and behavior of Costa.


 ** 3.3 The theme selector **

    The theme selector can be used to change the appearance of Costa to a
   number of predefined themes, some made by myself and some submitted by
   users of earlier versions. To change the theme, open the Configuration
   program and select "Theme selector".
   
    To select a theme, click one of the two arrow buttons on the screen or
   press the left and right keys to cycle through the themes. Once you've
   found one you like, click "Save" to apply the changes immediately. Click
   "Cancel" to discard you changes and return to the desktop without
   changing the theme.
    
    If none of the default themes suit your taste, use the included theme
   editor to make your own. User submitted teams are always welcome!


 ** 3.4 File associations **

    When enabled, file associations allow you to open files in the right
   program automatically. For instance, if .TXT files are associated with
   EDIT.COM and you try to open README.TXT, Costa will launch EDIT.COM and
   tell it to open README.TXT for you. This way, instead of writing

     C:\DOS\EDIT.COM C:\EXAMPLE\README.TXT

   you can just write

     C:\EXAMPLE\README.TXT

   with the exact same result.

    To edit file associations, Costa includes a small editor. Launch the
   configuration program, and select "File associations". Once the editor
   is loaded, it will tell you everything you need to know to edit file
   associations. It also enables you to disable this feature completely. If
   you disable it, and later want to enable it again, simple return to the
   file association editor.


 ** 3.5 Other settings **

    The last option in the Configuration program, "Other settings", allows
   you to tweak various aspects of Costa to make it behave exactly like you
   want it to. To toggle a feature on or off, click the checkbox in front of
   it. An X in a checkbox indicates an enabled feature, an empty checkbox
   indicates a disabled feature.

    - Show link descriptions
      Toggles whether or not the title of a link should be displayed.

    - Show link targets
      If "Show link descriptions" is enabled, you can choose to have the
      filename the link points to shown underneath the description.

    - Show link menu on both left and right click
      When enabled, you will get a menu regardless of which mouse button you
      use to click a link. If disabled, a menu will only be shown on right-
      click, and a left click will simply execute the link.

    - Animate user interface
      Makes the bar at the top of the desktop and link menus appear and
      disappear using a sliding animation, which looks nice but results in
      a short delay.

    - Confirm when trying to exit Costa
      If enabled you will be asked if you really want to exit Costa when you
      click the "Exit" button on the desktop.

    - Grey out screen while showing a messagebox
      Draws a grey grid over the screen while a messagebox is shown, so that
      only the messagebox is visible. Although it looks nice it results in
      a delayed showing of the messagebox, and is thus disabled by default.

    - Show start-up "Tip of the Day" messages
      If enabled, Costa will - once per day - show a messagebox with a tip.
      These tips help you discover features in Costa, or smarter ways to
      perform certain tasks.

    - Use last profile on start-up without asking
      If enabled, Costa will select the last used profile automatically at
      launch, instead of showing the profile selection dialog. Useful if you
      don't make use of the profile feature.
