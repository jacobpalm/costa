                               Version 1.7.0
                               By Jacob Palm                   

                                 Changelog


*1.7.0*
Version 1.7.0 is all about making it easier to work with files. To fullfil
this goal, a file selector has been added. This can be used to visually
browse folders and select a file, instead of having to type path and filename
in input fields. This is used for example when adding a desktop link, or
opening a file in the text viewer.
  -File selector added for easier handling of files, without having to
   memorize paths and filenames

*1.6.0*
The most notable change of 1.6.0 is the addiction of EGA support. Now, Costa
will run on computers with an Enhanced Graphics Adapter with at least 64 KB
memory, broadening the range of computers on which Costa is supported. The
new EGA mode is also considerably faster on older machines (pre-1990).
  -Support for both EGA/VGA (640x350) and VGA (640x480) graphics, and the
   ability to switch between them on the fly
  -New default theme - more lively than the one used in 1.5.0
  -New logo, for the first time ever. Since most other icons have changed,
   I gave the logo an overhaul as well, to now feature a blue floppy disk
   instead of the old black one
  -Font files converted from text format to binary format, reducing load time
   by 88%
  -Proprietary icons from Windows and games removed, and replaced with icons
   drawn by myself. There are two reasons for this - for starters, I don't
   own these icons, and won't be using them without permission. I also want
   to make as much as possible myself, rather than using things others have
   made
  -FILETYPE.DAT, which hold file association configuration data, will now be
   recreated automatically if missing. Now, as long as the font files and all
   EXE files are present, Costa will run even if all other files are deleted
  -Bug fixes, mostly graphical

*1.5.0*
This version comes with many minor improvements and changes, but three stand
out from the rest: A new UI design based on Costa 0.9.4, massive speed
improvements to handling of data files, and full keyboard support in all
accessories.
Code optimizations has also helped reduced the combined size of Costas 
executables significantly.
  -UI layout from Costa 0.9.4 brought to life again, and all themes have been
   converted to fit this change. Costa now has a much more unique look, based
   on old sketches I drew in Microsoft Paint 14 years ago. Oh, nostalgia!
  -Data formats from config files and theme files changed from INI format to
   binary format, massively improving loading/saving times.
  -Icon files converted to raw memory format, major speed improvements
  -More data cached in memory (for instance, all settings) to reduce disk I/O
   and improve performance on older machines
  -Added sounds and save state to Tic Tac Toe - pick up your game where you
   left off!
  -Desk links are now opened with double click, like in almost any other GUI
  -Full keyboard support in theme editor and icon editor
  -Fixed minor graphical glitches, and removed superfluous drawing calls
  -Heavily reduced interrupt calls to mouse driver, while also reducing
   amount of mouse function calls in code, to improve performance further
  -Having read up on compiler options and optimizations, I was able to reduce
   the size of executables by a combined size of around 130 KB
  -Better error handling whenever working with files


*1.4.0*
As with the previous release, the focus with this release has mainly been
on behind-the-scenes improvements. A long requested flood fill function has
been added to the icon editor.
  -Fill functionality ("paint bucket") for Icon Editor - right click any area
   to fill out that area with the current color. Makes for much easier
   editing!
  -New icon format, cutting size of icons on disk roughly in half
  -Heavy optimizations for icon editor
  -Several minor bug fixes - running Costa on a Windows machine produced
   bugs not present in DOSBox. These have been corrected. CuteMouse driver
   replaced with Microsofts mouse.com, since the former produced errors on
   some Windows machines.
  -More icons and themes


*1.3.0*
Most of the stuff in this release takes place behind the scenes, where a
bunch of minor bugs, typos etc. has been fixed. There is one major addition
though - at last, Costa has a built-in theme editor!
  -New theme editor - allowing you to edit any theme, and modify the colors
   to your liking. User submitted themes are welcome!
  -Moved accessories out of desktop, and into separate programs, for easier
   development and modularity
  -Fixed bug introduced in 1.2.0, where the procedure responsible for running
   external programs did not put a space between the command/filename and the
   parameters, breaking some desktop links
  -More icons added - including one for everyones favorite game, MS-DOS
   Gorillas!
  -Moved Configuration from a desktop link to a button in top panel, to free 
   up screen real estate for user links
  -Minor bugfixes
  -Theme files (.thm) now associated with Theme Editor

*1.2.0*
This version brings back a feature from the past - the multi-user support
from version 0.8.0 has resurfaced as "Profiles", allowing more people to
share the same installation of Costa - or one person to have separate
profiles for work, play etc.
Also in this version is a number of bug fixes and other refinements.
  -Support for multiple profiles added, with each profile having its own
   settings, theme and personal desktop links
  -Added more tips for "Tip of the Day" dialog, to help users discover more
   hidden (or less well-known) features of Costa
  -Fixed bug in icon editor that resulted in a blank pixel being drawn when
   the left mouse button was lifted
  -Fixed bug in icon editor that caused it to repeatedly ask for confirmation
   before overwrite on each save, even if the icon had already been saved to
   that same filename
  -Fixed bug that allowed paths to be shown belong icon captions, instead of
   just filenames, which cluttered the desktop with text

*1.1.0*
This version contained mostly minor improvements to Costa.
  -Added "Tip of the Day" dialog, which can be enabled/disabled from the
   configuration editor
  -DESKLINK.DAT will now be recreated automatically if missing. This also 
   allows built-in icons to be recreated, since they cannot be added/edited 
   through the UI.
  -Bug in checkboxes fixed, no more graphical glitches when moving cursor
   after checking/unchecking
  -Fixed bug that would in some cases make text on desktop icons disappear
  -More icons included

*1.0.0*
At last, after almost a decade of hobby coding, Costa had reached the 1.0.0
milestone and was no longer in the BETA phase! I worked on various TUI (Text-
mode User Interfaces) from 2001 onwards, before switching to GUI development
and releasing the first version of Costa in 2004.
Since version 0.9.9, not much has changed - the focus was on improving
stability, and fixing any bugs I could stumble upon.
  -Documentation finished
  -Various bugfixes and stability improvements
  -Parts of the code have been further optimized
  -The icon editor now has an icon selector - you can use the arrow keys to
   browse icons you can load, instead of having to type a filename
  -More icons have been added using the image editor introduced in 0.9.9
  -Instead of redrawing the entire textbox when scrolling using the arrow
   keys in TextViewer, I am now using GET/PUT to move the lines and only
   draw the one new line using the font routine. This improves scrolling
   dramatically, as the font routine is the bottleneck of the UI
  -The icon editor will now ask before owerwriting an existing icon
  -The icon editor now draws its grid using a pattern of grey and black,
   rather than just black, so that the grid is still visible when a region
   is painted black

*BETA 0.9.9*
Version 0.9.9 is mostly a heavily optimized version of 0.9.8 with a few
features and an icon editor added.
I noticed that each source file grew a lot when compiled into an EXE,
which meant that since all of Costas accessories where compiled separately
there was a lot of space to be saved by compiling to a single EXE. This
would also mean faster execution. The only downfall would be the increased
memory usage - or so I thought. By heavily optimizing the code I
managed to squeeze all accessories into an EXE file less than 165 KB in size,
saving about 400 KB disk space! The desktop alone from 0.9.8 was 105 KB, so
that's quite decent.
  -All programs combined into one EXE file for improved speed and less disk
   usage - the reduced loading from disk means great speed improvements on
   slow drives and floppy disks
  -Added an icon editor, which for the first time allows users of Costa to
   create their own icons
  -COSTA.EXE replaced with COSTA.BAT - works exactly the same, but uses about
   50 KB less RAM when running external programs
  -When using TAB to switch between desktop links, you can now press
   SHIFT+TAB to go in the other direction
  -Added the ability to associate programs with the built-in text viewer by
   associating them with COSTA099.EXE
  -Costa now uses an environment variable, %COSTA099%, to remember the path
   to its files. COSTA.BAT automatically sets the environment variable. This
   means that C:\CPATH.INI is no longer required, which also allows Costa to
   run on systems without a C: drive
  -Textviewer for viewing small text files (tested to work with files up to
   60 KB in size before running out of string space)
  -Input dialog fixed, keyboard navigation now works for the textbox


*BETA 0.9.8*
I came to the conclusion that Costa wasn't developing at the speed I wanted
it to. The reason for this was that I needed to design a complete scripting
language and write a parser for it before I could actually start making
programs for Costa, which meant that all my time was used on the parser. So I 
decided that the best for Costa was to return to single-tasking, like back in
the old days when I released a new version frequently.
  -Once again, a complete rewrite. I had learned a lot in the past years, and
   this would be the final rewrite. I was now heading for a 1.0-release
  -Desktop completed, with moveable icons, menus and more
  -Animations. Parts of the UI are animated, which can be disabled through a
   configuration file if desired
  -Configurations are stored in plain-text files to allow easy editing
  -All controls implemented and working like a charm
  -The user interface resembles the one from 0.8.0
  -3 different fonts, 2 of them are even variable width fonts
  -File associations, customizable through FILETYPE.CFG or the config util
  -New binary icon format, with 4 times faster draws and smaller files
  -Configuration program, with theme selector, file association editor, and
   a dialog with checkboxes for various settings such as animations and
   desktop appearance
  -Keyboard navigation. If you unplug your mouse, you'll still be able to
   use Costa since everything has a hotkey, shown using an underlined letter
   (you don't have to press ALT, just the underlined letter). Desktop links
   can be used without a mouse too, using the TAB and ENTER keys.
  -Tic Tac Toe is back, also rewritten from scratch. This time with both 1
   and 2 player support
  -Calculator, for simple calculations (+, -, * and /)
  -Desktop links are sorted left to right, top to bottom - meaning that they
   have the right TAB order
  -The mouse no longer disappears when editing a textbox
  -Much more error handling. No matter what files are missing, Costa won't
   crash. It might show an error and exit, but it won't crash. Config files
   are automatically recreated with default values. Removed directories will
   also be recreated, to avoid path errors.


*BETA 0.9.5*
This unreleased version was a little crazy. It's actually just 0.9.4, which
can be seen if you look at the script files. All GUI code was removed, and
replaced with TUI code. This made Costa a text-mode program, but still with
moveable windows and such. It was kind of nice, and worked well. But it was
more of an experiment than anything else.


*BETA 0.9.4*
Due to the failure of Costa 0.9.3, the 0.9.2 code was pulled out, cleaned up
and was briefly being used for Costa 0.9.4, which was released on the 28th of 
December, 2006.
  -A lot of the things present in 0.9.3 was written from scratch for this
   release, on top of the code from 0.9.2
  -A new, stylish black/white theme was implemented


*BETA 0.9.3*
Costa 0.9.3 was never released, but it had a lot of improvements over 0.9.2
that made it my personal favourite of the task-swapping editions. Sadly, the
code suffered from bad planning and messy programming style. On the 19th of
May, 2006 Costa 0.9.3 was cancelled.
  -Labels (text) on windows
  -Textboxes finally implemented and working
  -Icon support (not on desktop, though)
  -Drastically improved script parser with many new commands


*BETA 0.9.2*
Although never released to the public, this version was a great improvement
over 0.9.1.
  -New button design
  -Less flicker and faster redraws
  -Improved windowing engine
  -Bug in task manager was fixed, it can now be accessed at any time and not
   just when the GUI is idle
  -A lot of scripts
  -More themes


*BETA 0.9.1*
This is just about the same as BETA 0.9.0, with only a few improvements and
additions.
  -Screen resolution can now be changed
  -It is possible to run up to 5 scripts automatically when Costa loads.
  -Buttons on the windows are now supported
  -All settings are now stored in COSTA.INI
  -More themes and a document describing how to make your own
  -Windows draw a lot faster
  -A few more example scripts


*BETA 0.9.0*
Yup, you guessed it. Costa has - once again - been rewritten from scratch.
This time to include task-swapping and a script parser!
  -Rewritten from scratch
  -Scripting engine
  -Everything is written in Costa's own scripting language, meaning you can
   change almost anything!
  -Task-switching. You can run a lot of scripts at the same time!
  -Color themes
  -Custom shell script (the shell script is the equivalent of Windows'
   explorer.exe)


*BETA 0.8.0*
Once again completely rewritten from scratch, this time with lots of
improvements.
  -Rewritten from scratch
  -Themes (Costa, Mac OS 1.1, Windows 95 and Windows 3.11)
  -Desktop replaced with a program manager like the one in Windows 3.x
  -EXE runner from BETA 0.7.0 included
  -Toolbar for editing icons in the program manager
  -A lot of "under-the-hood" optimizations
  -Multi-user support! Up to 5 users can have their own icon profiles, themes
   and desktop colors. Users can be protected using an encrypted password.
  -Auto logon. If there's only one person using Costa, he/she can use auto
   logon to go directly to the program manager.
  -Some of the first chapter of the "User's Guide and Reference".
  -Smaller icon format. In average the icons lost 1 KB in size each.
  -Tool to update icons from BETA 0.7.0 to the new format.
  -INI-files. All settings for Costa and the user profiles are stored in
   INI-files.
  -Icons are read from a folder instead of a file.


*BETA 0.7.0*
This release of Costa was very popular (I got a lot of positive reactions to
it).
  -Improved scripting language, now with variable support. All commands in
   the scripting language will accept variables instead of parameters.
  -Documentation
  -Built-in desktop customization. No more editing files! Icons can be moved,
   added and deleted just by right clicking the desktop
  -Some improvements in the code for speed and stability
  -Costa takes up 200 KB RAM, but thanks to a new EXE runner Costa only takes
   up 40 KB RAM when running external programs
  -Some bug fixes and small improvements to some graphics and icons


*BETA 0.6.0*
Released in early 2005, Costa 0.6.0 had a lot of improvements over the last
versions.
  -The desktop is back, better than ever and fully customizable!
  -File-viewer has been rewritten from scratch once again, this time to
   improve speed and reduce the size of CostaFormat files (the file format
   used by File-viewer)
  -Scripting engine greatly improved, many more commands added (now supports
   clickable buttons which will execute a block of code ONLY if the button
   was clicked)
  -Fixed bug in Tic Tac Toe which allowed the X player to put an X to much
  -Graphical form designer, to ease the progress of creating dialogs for use
   in scripts


*BETA 0.4.0*
This release was more of a preview than a BETA. It took the user on a quick
tour, showing some of the accessories.
  -File-viewer greatly improved. Now supports text colors and more
  -Tic Tac Toe (I like that game!)
  -Scripting language once again rewritten from scratch
  -Desktop trashed, a new one will be written from scratch
  -Costa now reads all string from language files, making it possible to
   translate Costa, or just change the string for fun
  -Had a short start-up sound played through the PC speaker (just for fun,
   won't be there in the final version, not even the next one)
  -Screen resolution changed from 640x480 to 640x350. It reduces the amount
   of text which can fit on the screen, but it gives me the ability to remove
   almost all flicker
  -Inputbox updated, now the entire textbox isn't redrawn when pressing
   backspace
  -Scripting language back, rewritten from scratch!
  

*BETA 0.3.3*
With 0.3.3, the third release of Costa, things really started to look better.

The second release of Costa. Had many improvements over 0.0.1.
  -Script support. All accessories (except for the DOS-Prompt and paint) was
   made using scripts.
  -Painting-program (could only save bitmaps, bitmap loading routine didn't
   make it to this version)
