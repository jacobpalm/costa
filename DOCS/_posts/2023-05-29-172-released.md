Keeping up with the spirit of 1.7.1, this new release does not bring many new features, but focuses on improvements instead.

A grid has been implemented on the desktop, making icons move in 8 pixel increments. This makes it vastly easier to align the icons nicely on the desktop, both using the mouse and the keyboard, and I am quite please with it. It's a small thing, but the effect is great!

Other than that, a whole bunch of bug fixes and some minor optimizations. Anyone using 1.7.0 or 1.7.1 should update to this version to avoid issues, in particular an issue where an extra backslash was sometimes present in some paths, making Costa crash on certain systems.
