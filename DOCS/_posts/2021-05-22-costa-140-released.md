While it may not look like much has changed, there's quite a few changes behind the scenes in this new version.<!--more-->

The icon editor has been heavily optimized, and a new flood fill feature has been added. You can now right-click anywhere to paint an area with the current color. The icon format has also been optimized - a change that has roughly reduced the size of each icon on disk by half.

Full details about this and previous releases are available in the [archive]({{ site.baseURL }}/archive/140.html#versioninfo).
