After a 2&frac12; year hiatus, I have once again pulled the source code for Costa out of storage, and added some new features. This time around, I've implemented some bug fixes, and a whole new theme editor.

With this new theme editor, users can now customize any color of the interface - either by modifying existing themes, or making their own. User submissions are welcome!<!--more-->

Full details about this and previous releases are available in the [archive]({{ site.baseURL }}/archive/130.html#versioninfo).
