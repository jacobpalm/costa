I've just released version 0.8.0 of my [QuickBASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickBASIC) [GUI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface), Costa for MS-DOS. It has many new features, including themes and multiuser support.
No accessories are included (didn't wanna include half-finished tools), but it's still a fully functional GUI.<!--more-->

You can download Costa here: <{{ site.baseURL }}/downloads/costa080.zip>

Or, if you want more information about this beta, check the archive: <{{ site.baseURL }}/archive/080.html#versioninfo>

**Note:** Before running Costa, be sure to read _INFO!!!.TXT_ and run _USERS.EXE_ (read the document first).

I'm open to suggestions and comments.
