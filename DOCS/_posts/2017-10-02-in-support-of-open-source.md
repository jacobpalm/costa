Over the past couple of years I have been using Open Source software increasingly. More and more of the applications I use everyday have been replaced by open source alternatives, and I now only have a handful of proprietary software left. Even my operating system has been replaced by Ubuntu Gnome.

Since I am using so much open source software, I figured I would live up to this ideal by releasing the source code to one of my own pieces of software, The Costa GUI.

As of September 2017, the full source code is available on GitHub:
<https://github.com/jacobpalm/costa>

This also fulfills a long overdue promise I made several years ago on my old GUI related website, where I declared that the code would be available once version 1.0 was released.
