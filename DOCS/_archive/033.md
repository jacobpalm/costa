An incremental update over 0.3.0, this release did not bring much new functionality. There was a major change to the underlying code, though. All GUI related code was move to a so called "quick library", allowing the same code to be written and maintained in one place but used in different programs. This allowed subsequent versions to be developed far easier.

- Script support removed, going to be rewritten
- Keyboard-controlled desktop (no mouse support on desktop, didn't finish it on time)
- Improved speed and stability
