As with the previous release, the focus with this release has mainly been on behind-the-scenes improvements. A long requested flood fill function has been added to the icon editor.

- Fill functionality ("paint bucket") for Icon Editor - right click any area to fill out that area with the current color. Makes for much easier editing!
- New icon format, cutting size of icons on disk roughly in half
- Heavy optimizations for icon editor
- Several minor bug fixes - running Costa on a Windows machine produced bugs not present in DOSBox. These have been corrected. CuteMouse driver replaced with Microsoft's mouse.com, since the former produced errors on some Windows machines.
- More icons and themes
