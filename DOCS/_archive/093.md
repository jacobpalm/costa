Costa 0.9.3 was never officially released, but is available here for historic reasons. It had a lot of improvements over 0.9.2 that made it my personal favorite of the task-swapping editions. Sadly, the code suffered from bad planning and messy programming style. On the 19th of May, 2006 Costa 0.9.3 was canceled.

- Labels (text) on windows
- Textboxes finally implemented and working
- Icon support (not on desktop, though)
- Drastically improved script parser with many new commands
