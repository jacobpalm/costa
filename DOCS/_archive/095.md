This unreleased version was a little crazy. It's actually just 0.9.4, which can be seen if you look at the script files. All GUI code was removed, and replaced with TUI code. This made Costa a text-mode program, but still with moveable windows and such. It was kind of nice, and worked well. But it was more of an experiment than anything else. It was made available here in September 2015, for those interested in seeing it.
