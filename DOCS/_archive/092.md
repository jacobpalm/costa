Although never released to the public, this version was a great improvement over 0.9.1. It has sadly been lost, and cannot be downloaded.

- New button design
- Less flicker and faster redraws
- Improved windowing engine
- Bug in task manager was fixed, it can now be accessed at any time and not just when the GUI is idle
- A lot of scripts
- More themes
