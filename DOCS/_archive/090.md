Yup, you guessed it. Costa has - once again - been rewritten from scratch. This time to include task-swapping and a script parser!

- Rewritten from scratch
- Scripting engine
- Everything is written in Costa's own scripting language, meaning you can change almost anything!
- Task-switching. You can run a lot of scripts at the same time!
- Color themes
- Custom shell script (the shell script is the equivalent of Windows' explorer.exe)
