The most notable change of 1.6.0 is the addiction of EGA support. Now, Costa will run on computers with an Enhanced Graphics Adapter with at least 64 KB memory, broadening the range of computers on which Costa is supported. The new EGA mode is also considerably faster on older machines (pre-1990).

- Support for both EGA/VGA (640x350) and VGA (640x480) graphics, and the ability to switch between them on the fly
- New default theme - more lively than the one used in 1.5.0
- New logo, for the first time ever. Since most other icons have changed, I gave the logo an overhaul as well, to now feature a blue floppy disk instead of the old black one
- Font files converted from text format to binary format, reducing load time by 88%
- Proprietary icons from Windows and games removed, and replaced with icons drawn by myself. There are two reasons for this - for starters, I don't own these icons, and won't be using them without permission. I also want to make as much as possible myself, rather than using things others have made
- FILETYPE.DAT, which hold file association configuration data, will now be recreated automatically if missing. Now, as long as the font files and all EXE files are present, Costa will run even if all other files are deleted
- Bug fixes, mostly graphical
