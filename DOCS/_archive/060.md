Released in early 2005, Costa 0.6.0 had a lot of improvements over the last versions.

- The desktop is back, better than ever and fully customizable!
- File-viewer has been rewritten from scratch once again, this time to improve speed and reduce the size of CostaFormat files (the file format used by File-viewer)
- Scripting engine greatly improved, many more commands added (now supports clickable buttons which will execute a block of code ONLY if the button was clicked)
- Fixed bug in Tic Tac Toe which allowed the X player to put an X to much
- Graphical form designer, to ease the progress of creating dialogs for use in scripts
