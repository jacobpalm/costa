The major feature of this version was support for multiple profiles - meaning more users could share the same installation of Costa, or that one use could have separate profiles for work, play etc.

- Support for multiple profiles added, with each profile having its own settings, theme and personal desktop links
- Added more tips for "Tip of the Day" dialog, to help users discover more hidden (or less well-known) features of Costa
- Fixed bug in icon editor that resulted in a blank pixel being drawn when the left mouse button was lifted
- Fixed bug in icon editor that caused it to repeatedly ask for confirmation before overwrite on each save, even if the icon had already been saved to that same filename
- Fixed bug that allowed paths to be shown belong icon captions, instead of just filenames, which cluttered the desktop with text
