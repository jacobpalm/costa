Once again completely rewritten from scratch, this time with lots of improvements.

- Rewritten from scratch
- Themes (Costa, Mac OS 1.1, Windows 95 and Windows 3.11)
- Desktop replaced with a program manager like the one in Windows 3.x
- EXE runner from BETA 0.7.0 included
- Toolbar for editing icons in the program manager
- A lot of "under-the-hood" optimizations
- Multi-user support! Up to 5 users can have their own icon profiles, themes and desktop colors. Users can be protected using an encrypted password.
- Auto logon. If there's only one person using Costa, he/she can use auto logon to go directly to the program manager.
- Some of the first chapter of the "User's Guide and Reference".
- Smaller icon format. In average the icons lost 1 KB in size each.
- Tool to update icons from BETA 0.7.0 to the new format.
- INI-files. All settings for Costa and the user profiles are stored in INI-files.
- Icons are read from a folder instead of a file.
