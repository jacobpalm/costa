This version contained mostly minor improvements to Costa.

- Added "Tip of the Day" dialog, which can be enabled/disabled from the configuration editor
- DESKLINK.DAT will now be recreated automatically if missing. This also allows built-in icons to be recreated, since they cannot be added/edited through the UI.
- Bug in checkboxes fixed, no more graphical glitches when moving cursor after checking/unchecking
- Fixed bug that would in some cases make text on desktop icons disappear
- More icons included
