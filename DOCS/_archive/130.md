Most of the stuff in this release takes place behind the scenes, where a bunch of minor bugs, typos etc. has been fixed. There is one major addition though - at last, Costa has a built-in theme editor!

- New theme editor - allowing you to edit any theme, and modify the colors to your liking. User submitted themes are welcome!
- Moved accessories out of desktop, and into separate programs, for easier development and modularity
- Fixed bug introduced in 1.2.0, where the procedure responsible for running external programs did not put a space between the command/filename and the parameters, breaking some desktop links
- More icons added - including one for everyone's favorite game, MS-DOS Gorillas!
- Moved Configuration from a desktop link to a button in top panel, to free up screen real estate for user links
- Minor bugfixes
- Theme files (.thm) now associated with Theme Editor
