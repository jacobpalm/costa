This release of Costa was very popular (I got a lot of positive reactions to it).

- Improved scripting language, now with variable support. All commands in the scripting language will accept variables instead of parameters.
- Documentation
- Built-in desktop customization. No more editing files! Icons can be moved, added and deleted just by right clicking the desktop
- Some improvements in the code for speed and stability
- Costa takes up 200 KB RAM, but thanks to a new EXE runner Costa only takes up 40 KB RAM when running external programs
- Some bug fixes and small improvements to some graphics and icons
