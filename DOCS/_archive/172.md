Aside from one minor new feature, 1.7.2 brings bugfixes and further optimizations.

- Implemented an 8x8 pixel grid on the desktop, so that icons are moved in increments of 8 pixels. This makes it much, much easier to align icons with mouse or keyboard
- Fixed extra backslash in some paths, which caused issues on some systems
- Minor optimizations, like not constantly showing/hiding mouse while drawing on screen, instead hiding once and showing when done drawing
- Fixed bug in status bar display in Tic Tac Toe
- Fixed mouse cursor not always showing at launch
