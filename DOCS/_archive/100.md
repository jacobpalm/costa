Since version 0.9.9, not much has changed - the focus was on improving stability and fixing any bugs I could stumble upon.

- Documentation finished
- Various bugfixes and stability improvements
- Parts of the code further optimized
- The icon editor now has an icon selector, instead of requiring a filename to open an existing icon
- More icons has been added using the image editor introduced in 0.9.9
- TextViewer no longer redraws the entire screen when scrolling, improving performance drastically
- The icon editor will now ask before overwriting an existing icon
- The icon editor now draws its grid using a pattern of grey and black, rather than just black, so that the grid is still visible when a region is painted black
