                    Release instructions for new versions

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 These instructions act as a checklist for the release of new versions of
Costa - what tasks must be performed, what files should be included, etc.

 If you are compiling your own version of Costa, you do not need to follow
these strictly. They are mainly written to help myself remember every detail
when releasing a new version.

 - Update version information in SOURCE\APPINFO.BI
 - Update version text in the icon "LOGO"
 - Update version information in DOCS\HELP.TXT, and read through to see if
   any information about new/changes features need to be documented.
   Take note of section 1.3 - "News in this version."
 - Update changelog in DOCS\CHANGES.TXT
 - Update year in LICENSE, if relevant
 - Compile all EXE files by running _BUILD.BAT
   Manual compiler options, if needed:
     Use 286 optimizations, include run-time error checking.
     Compile all with VBDOS standard library loaded (/L parameter)
 - Remove all .DAT files from the DATA\CONFIG folder - make sure to
   keep .DEF files which contains the default desktop icons, file
   associations etc.
 - Copy _DISTRUB.BAT to COSTA.BAT (contains "first run" information for the
   user)
 - Exclude the following from the ZIP file:
   SOURCE folder
   .gif folder
   .gitignore
   .ds_store files from all subfolders if packaging on a Mac
   README.MD
   All files with a name starting with underscore
 - Merge Git branch to main, if any
 - Tag a release on GitHub for this version, and add the ZIP archive for
   the release
 - After final commit and push to Git, create ZIP archive of source for
   own archive
 - Update website with download link, archive and screenshots
